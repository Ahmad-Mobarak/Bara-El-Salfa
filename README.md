## 📖 About The Game

**Bara Al-Salfa** (literally "Outside the Topic") is a web-based implementation of the popular social deduction party game. It is designed specifically for the Arab community with a polished **RTL (Right-to-Left)** interface and culturally relevant categories.

In this game, players are detectives trying to figure out who among them is "The Outsider"—the one person who doesn't know the secret word. The Outsider's goal? Blend in, lie, and figure out the secret word before getting caught!

## 🎯 How to Play

### 1. Setup Phase
1.  **Host** selects a category (e.g., Animals) and player count on one device.
2.  Pass the device around! Each player taps to reveal their identity.
    * **Regular Players:** See the secret word (e.g., "Lion").
    * **The Outsider:** Sees "You are the Outsider" (Bara Al-Salfa).

### 2. Discussion Phase 💬
Players take turns describing the word *without* giving it away completely.
* *Player A (Lion):* "It lives in the jungle."
* *Player B (Lion):* "It has a loud voice."
* *Outsider (Guessing):* "It... eats meat?"

### 3. Voting & Scoring 🗳️

| Outcome | Points Awarded |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Outsider Caught** | Regular Players get **+100 pts** ✅ |
